# netsage-grafana-configs

This repository contains the dashboard configuration files used by NetSage. The configuration files are managed using a tool called [wizzy](https://github.com/utkarshcmu/wizzy). A [Docker container](https://www.docker.com) is provided that sets-up a development environment with Grafana, wizzy, and the required plugins to run a full NetSage instance.
